            <p>I thought using loops was cheating, so I programmed my own using samples.
                I then thought using samples was cheating, so I recorded real drums.
                I then thought that programming it was cheating, so I learned to play drums for real.
                I then thought using bought drums was cheating, so I learned to make my own.
                I then thought using premade skins was cheating, so I killed a goat and skinned it.
                I then thought that that was cheating too, so I grew my own goat from a baby goat.
                I also think that is cheating, but I’m not sure where to go from here.
                <b>I haven’t made any music lately, what with the goat farming and all</b>.
